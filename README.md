# Active Learning-Based BERT for Pathology Synopsis Semantic Embeddings

## Introduction

This project explores the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, enhanced by Active Learning strategies, to generate high-quality semantic embeddings from pathology synopses. The focus is on improving the accuracy and efficiency of disease diagnosis in the healthcare sector.

## Overview

- **Objective**: To develop a methodology that utilizes BERT, a transformer-based language model, combined with active learning to extract and generate diagnostically relevant semantic embeddings from pathology synopses.

- **Motivation**: Addressing the challenge of efficiently processing unstructured or semi-structured medical text data (pathology synopses) to aid in disease diagnosis and treatment.

## Technologies Used

- **BERT Model**: A pre-trained transformer-based model developed by Google, known for its effectiveness in understanding the context of words in search queries.
  
- **Active Learning**: A technique used to select the most informative unlabeled data points for labeling, thereby improving the model's performance with fewer training data.

## Implementation

### Stage 1: Fine-tuning the BERT Model
- The BERT model is fine-tuned on a small labeled dataset of pathology synopses to adapt to the medical domain, focusing on learning the structure of the synopses to generate semantic embeddings.

### Stage 2: Active Learning
- Implements an active learning strategy to iteratively select and label the most informative unlabeled data points, updating the BERT model to enhance its predictive accuracy and efficiency.

## Results

The active learning-based BERT model demonstrated superior performance over several baseline models, including traditional BERT without active learning, in terms of accuracy and F1 score, proving the effectiveness of the combined approach for medical diagnosis.

## Conclusion

The integration of BERT with active learning represents a significant advancement in processing pathology synopses for disease diagnosis, offering a promising direction for future research in the medical NLP domain.
